# Assets Folder

## Required Assets for app.json

The following assets are referenced in `app.json` but are optional for development:
- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024 recommended)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen (1242x2436 recommended)
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (48x48)

You can create these later or use Expo's default assets.

## Location Images

Add your location images here:
- `locations/flint.jpg` - Flint Hall image
- `locations/ow.jpg` - O'Brian Hall image
- `locations/su.jpg` - Student Union image
- `locations/paula.jpg` - Paula Plaza image
- `locations/tims.jpg` - Tim Hortons image

The app will work without these images (it shows placeholders), but adding them will make it look better!
